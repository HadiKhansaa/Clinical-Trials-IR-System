    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to find out if methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted&#xD;
      psychotherapy is safe and can help people with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) arising&#xD;
      from being a victim of a crime.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs in response to a traumatic event or events. It is&#xD;
      most likely to occur following an event involving perceived personal threat, such as rape or&#xD;
      physical assault. PTSD is clearly a public health problem that causes a great deal of&#xD;
      suffering and accounts for a significant portion of health care costs. This study will&#xD;
      examine whether two sessions of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy&#xD;
      can be safely administered to participants with PTSD, and whether MDMA-assisted&#xD;
      psychotherapy, when compared with placebo-assisted therapy, will reduce PTSD symptoms after&#xD;
      each session and two months after the second session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDMA is a substance possessing unique effects that make it well suited to intensive&#xD;
      psychotherapy. MDMA has been hypothesized to represent a new class of drugs, called&#xD;
      entactogens, that produce feelings of closeness to others, empathy, well being, and&#xD;
      insightfulness. Currently, MDMA is scheduled (illegal) and cannot be used outside of research&#xD;
      studies like this one. Anecdotal reports of therapy conducted before MDMA was made illegal&#xD;
      suggest that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may benefit people with PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in twenty people ages 18 to 70 with PTSD&#xD;
      either related to crime victimization or combat, when combat-related PTSD lasts no longer&#xD;
      than five years, and that has not gotten better after psychotherapy and treatment with an&#xD;
      SSRI (selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, such as Paxil).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study lasts three to four months. Participants attend up to fourteen (14) ordinary&#xD;
      (non-drug) psychotherapy sessions with the investigators as well as two eight hour long&#xD;
      experimental (MDMA or placebo) sessions and one MDMA session. People taking part in this&#xD;
      study cannot take any psychiatric medication during the study period. People will either get&#xD;
      125 mg MDMA or placebo &quot;by chance,&quot; as by coin-toss, with twelve of twenty (60%) getting MDMA&#xD;
      during each experimental session, and eight of twenty (40%) getting placebo. Two to two and a&#xD;
      half hours later, if you and the investigators agree it is alright, you will take a second&#xD;
      supplemental, dose of MDMA or placebo. The supplemental dose will be half the size of the&#xD;
      first dose. The same investigators conducting non-drug therapy sessions conduct the&#xD;
      experimental sessions. All participants are required to stay the night at the clinic after&#xD;
      each experimental session. Participants meet with the investigators for a non-drug assisted&#xD;
      therapy session the day after each experimental session. A third MDMA session in this&#xD;
      placebo-controlled stage of the study will only be for people who received MDMA in the first&#xD;
      two sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTSD symptoms are measured at the start of the study, four days after each experimental&#xD;
      session, and finally two months after the second experimental session. People are tested on&#xD;
      memory and problem solving when they first enter the study and again two months after the&#xD;
      second experimental session. PTSD symptoms are measured to see whether there are any changes&#xD;
      in symptoms during the study, and tests of thinking, memory and problem-solving are meant to&#xD;
      spot any changes that could be due to MDMA or MDMA-assisted therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who recieved MDMA who complete the final evaluation, and upon discussion with&#xD;
      the investigators, will undergo a third MDMA session. The third session will happen&#xD;
      approximately two months after the second experimental session This session is &quot;open label,&quot;&#xD;
      meaning that they and the investigators will both know they are receiving MDMA. It will be&#xD;
      followed by one psychotherapy session a day after this session and two additional&#xD;
      psychotherapy sessions in the following weeks. PTSD symptoms will be measured again two&#xD;
      months after the third MDMA session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who received placebo and complete the final evaluation two months after the&#xD;
      second experimental procedure will be given an opportunity to take part in an open-label&#xD;
      continuation of the study where they will receive an initial dose of 125 mg MDMA and a&#xD;
      supplemental dose of 62.5 mg MDMA in up to three experimental sessions scheduled three to&#xD;
      five weeks apart. Participants in this open-label continuation will act as their own&#xD;
      controls. The open-label continuation lasts three months and will involve nine more visits&#xD;
      with the investigators, including the two experimental sessions.&#xD;
