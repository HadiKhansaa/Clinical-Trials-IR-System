  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New York esophageal antigen-1 (NY-ESO-1) and L antigen family member (LAGE)-1a antigens are&#xD;
      tumor-associated proteins that have been found in several tumor types. Clinical trials using&#xD;
      adoptively transferred T-cells directed against NY-ESO-1/LAGE-1a have shown objective&#xD;
      responses. Letetresgene autoleucel (GSK3377794) is the first generation of NY-ESO-1 specific&#xD;
      T-cell receptor engineered TCR T-cells. This protocol investigates letetresgene autoleucel&#xD;
      treatment in Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)*-A*02+ participants with NY-ESO1+ advanced&#xD;
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer as second line treatment.&#xD;
