      The purpose of the sudy is to conduct a small study to gather the preliminary data for future&#xD;
      lage scale clinical studies that will be designed test the potential beneficial effect of&#xD;
      over-the counter study anti-oxidant drug called N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in patients with a&#xD;
      heart muscle condition called Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM). The present study is a pilot&#xD;
      feasibility study, the investigators want to find out whether the investigators can recruit&#xD;
      and retain patients with HCM in the study and whether these patients can tolerate this drug&#xD;
      and can stay on one year. Likewise, the investigators want to find out any potential side&#xD;
      effects that this drug might have and estimate whether ii has any beneficial effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to perform a pilot study in patients with hypertrophic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy (HCM) and mutations in genes encoding sarcomere proteins to assess safety and&#xD;
      gather the pre-requisite data for subsequent robust randomized placebo-controlled efficacy&#xD;
      studies with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). We will gather data on the recruitment, accrual,&#xD;
      retention, and compliance rates of HCM patients randomized to treatment with a placebo or two&#xD;
      escalating doses of NAC. Likewise, we will determine any potential side effects and estimate&#xD;
      the effect size of NAC on indices of cardiac hypertrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCM, the main focus of our research during the past two decades, is the most common cause of&#xD;
      sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the young and an important cause of morbidity in the elderly.&#xD;
      Despite its clinical impact, there is no effective pharmacological therapy for HCM. None of&#xD;
      the current pharmacological therapies reverses or attenuates cardiac hypertrophy or reduces&#xD;
      the risk of SCD in adults. Cardiac hypertrophy, the quintessential clinical feature of human&#xD;
      HCM, is a major determinant of morbidity and the risk of SCD. Regression of cardiac&#xD;
      hypertrophy is expected to improve morbidity and decrease the risk of SCD in HCM, as observed&#xD;
      upon regression of load-dependent cardiac hypertrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have generated transgenic rabbit and mouse models of HCM and shown that cardiac&#xD;
      hypertrophy and fibrosis could be reversed through genetic or pharmacological interventions.&#xD;
      Results with NAC, a precursor to glutathione; the largest intracellular thiol pool against&#xD;
      oxidative stress, were most promising. In three independent studies in two different&#xD;
      transgenic models of HCM (rabbits and mouse), treatment with NAC completely reversed cardiac&#xD;
      hypertrophy and fibrosis and improved indices of diastolic function. The ultimate goal of&#xD;
      every physician-scientist is to apply the bench discoveries at the bedside. We propose to&#xD;
      test our findings in the animal models in humans with HCM caused by sarcomere protein&#xD;
      mutations. The use of NAC is also supported by data showing increased oxidative stress in&#xD;
      human HCM. Moreover, NAC has been used extensively in humans and has a well-established&#xD;
      safety profile. Resources including patients with sarcomere protein mutations are available&#xD;
      to successfully complete a randomized placebo-controlled (N=25) pilot study to test two&#xD;
      escalating doses of NAC (N=50), administered for one year. We will determine recruitment,&#xD;
      accrual, retention and compliance rates; tolerability, safety and side effects; and estimate&#xD;
      the effect size of NAC on the indices of cardiac hypertrophy, as determined by serial cardiac&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the baseline and after one year of treatment. Only HCM&#xD;
      patients with sarcomere proteins mutations will be included to exclude phenocopy. The Core&#xD;
      centers will interpret the phenotypic data to assure homogeneity. Data Coordinating Center&#xD;
      will assist in the research design, planning and conduct of the study and analysis of the&#xD;
      data. The findings will set the stage for large-scale robust randomized placebo-control&#xD;
      efficacy studies.&#xD;
