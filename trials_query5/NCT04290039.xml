      This randomized, three-sequence, three-period, phase 1 study is designed to assess the&#xD;
      bioavailability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of sublingually administered atropine sulfate&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, three-sequence, three-period crossover study to assess the&#xD;
      bioavailability and PK of a single dose of atropine administered sublingually in healthy&#xD;
      adult volunteers. At least 15 healthy male and female volunteers will be enrolled to obtain&#xD;
      approximately 12 evaluable subjects in the per protocol population. Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of three treatment dosing sequences (A, B, or C).&#xD;

             whether the subject should be terminated from further dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who took any over-the-counter medication/vitamins/herbal supplements in the&#xD;
             last 72 hours prior to screening. Prior to each dose, the investigator will review&#xD;

             further dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with glaucoma and/or history of ocular surgery (including Lasik), ocular&#xD;

             and resting for at least five minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects with a history or current diagnosis of myasthenia gravis&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subjects with a history of drug or alcohol abuse in the last two years or evidence of&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Subjects with a known sensitivity or prior adverse reaction to atropine&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects cannot be rescreened for exclusionary laboratory test results. Potentially&#xD;
        exclusionary vital sign results may be repeated once. If a subject's repeat vitals remain&#xD;
        exclusionary or the investigator determines that the repeat vital signs could pose a risk&#xD;
        to the subject participating in the study, then the subject will be excluded.&#xD;
