  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of REGN5069 compared to&#xD;
      placebo in patients with pain due to radiographically-confirmed OA of the knee who have a&#xD;
      history of inadequate joint pain relief or intolerance to current analgesic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the concentrations of functional REGN5069 in serum over time when&#xD;
           patients are treated for up to 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of REGN5069 compared with placebo when patients&#xD;
           are treated for up to 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure levels of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) against REGN5069 following multiple IV&#xD;
           administrations&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Regeneron has discontinued further clinical development of REGN5069, an antibody to GFRα3,&#xD;
    which was previously being studied in osteoarthritis pain of the knee&#xD;
