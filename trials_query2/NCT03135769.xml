  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational trophoblastic neoplasias (GTN) are characterized by the persistence of elevated&#xD;
      hCG titers after complete uterine evacuation of a partial hydatidiform mole (PHM) or a&#xD;
      complete hydatidiform mole. GTN patients are commonly treated with single agent treatment&#xD;
      (methotrexate or actinomycine-D) or polychemotherapy (first line treatment EMA-CO) according&#xD;
      to the predicted risk of resistance to single agent treatment by FIGO score. GTN patients&#xD;
      with resistance to these treatments are treated with another single agent drug or&#xD;
      polychemotherapy regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy standard regimens are old and toxic for these young lady patients, with&#xD;
      potential long term effects detrimental for further maternity and quality of life. There is a&#xD;
      need for modern targeted agents with better benefit/toxicity profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a strong rational for investigating the anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibody avelumab in&#xD;
      chemoresistant GTN patients. Several elements suggest that the normal pregnancy immune&#xD;
      tolerance is &quot;hijacked&quot; by GTN cell for proliferating :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spontaneous regressions of metastasic GTN are regularly observed, thereby the role of&#xD;
           immune system for rejecting GTN cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strong and constant overexpression of PDL1 and NK cells has been found in all subtypes&#xD;
           and settings of GTN tumors from French reference gestational trophoblastic center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The case of complete and durable response to pembrolizumab was reported in a patient&#xD;
           with multi chemo-resistant GTN.&#xD;
