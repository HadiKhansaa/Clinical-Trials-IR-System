&#xD;
          -  Menopausal women (≥12 months since last menstrual period or bilateral oophorectomy or&#xD;
             with a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level ≥20 milli-international&#xD;
             units/millilitre (mIU/mL) and an estradiol level &lt;190pmol/l in the absence of a&#xD;
             reliable menstrual marker (hysterectomy with ovarian preservation or endometrial&#xD;
             ablation)) aged 40-62 years with &gt;7 hot flushes/day some of which are reported as&#xD;
             severe or bothersome who have not been on treatment for menopausal symptoms for the&#xD;
             preceding 8 weeks.&#xD;

             uncontrolled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure of ≥ 160 mmHg and/or&#xD;
             diastolic blood pressure of ≥100 mmHg); uncontrolled diabetes; or significant&#xD;
             pulmonary, renal, hepatic, endocrine, or other systemic disease in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 1.5 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &gt;1.5 times ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine &gt;2.0 times ULN&#xD;

         16. Clinically relevant disease and abnormalities (past or present), which in the opinion&#xD;
