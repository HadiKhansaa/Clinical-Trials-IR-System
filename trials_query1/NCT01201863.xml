    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to: Address 3 short term objectives; (1) Determine the effects&#xD;
      of physiologic testosterone (T) therapy on neurological function and functional independence&#xD;
      following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in hypogonadal men during inpatient rehabilitation;&#xD;
      (2) Document the natural history of neuroendocrine dysfunction and recovery in men during&#xD;
      inpatient rehabilitation after TBI; (3) Obtain data to validate the NIH toolbox, a novel&#xD;
      assessment of neurological function for use in the TBI population; and two long-term&#xD;
      objectives: (1) Utilize study findings to design a multicenter trial to further assess the&#xD;
      impact of T therapy in hypogonadal men following TBI and (2) Impact TBI practice management&#xD;
      with new information about neuroendocrine dysfunction after TBI and hormone treatments to&#xD;
      improve outcomes.&#xD;

      This study will assess the hormonal status of men on admission to an inpatient TBI&#xD;
      rehabilitation program. Eighty-eight Individuals with low Testosterone (T) levels will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either physiologic T therapy or placebo. Fifty-six Individuals with&#xD;
      sufficient levels of T will be followed as a second control group. All three groups will&#xD;
      undergo serial assessment of neurological function (as measured by the NIH Toolbox) and&#xD;
      functional independence (FIM) to correlate with hormone levels. Hormone levels will be&#xD;
      assessed through analysis of blood samples drawn from all participants at the time of study&#xD;
      screening and at two week intervals for a total of 7 blood draws during the 12 week study&#xD;
      period. Demographics, injury characteristics, concomitant medication usage and adverse events&#xD;
      will be documented by medical record review. Statistical analysis will be performed to test&#xD;
      study hypotheses. Findings will be disseminated at professional and consumer conferences and&#xD;
      in peer-reviewed journals and consumer-based publications. Results will also be made&#xD;
      available through the Craig Hospital website and via summary report to the Colorado TBI Trust&#xD;
      Fund Research Program. If T therapy is found to be effective, findings will be used as&#xD;
      preliminary data for a grant proposal for a multi-center trial.&#xD;

    <description>The most widely accepted functional assessment measure in use in the rehabilitation community in the US. 18-item ordinal scale useful for assessment of progress during inpatient rehabilitation. Measures independent performance in self-care, sphincter control, transfers, locomotion, communication, and social cognition. By adding the points for each item, the possible total score ranges from 18 to 126.</description>
