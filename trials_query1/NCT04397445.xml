    <textblock>
      Ranitidine is an over-the-counter and prescription drug, which decreases the amount of acid&#xD;
      secreted by the stomach. Some ranitidine medicines contain an impurity called&#xD;
      N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) at low levels. NDMA is classified as a probable human&#xD;
      carcinogen (a substance that could cause cancer) based on results from laboratory tests. NDMA&#xD;
      is a known environmental contaminant and found in water and foods, including meats, dairy&#xD;
      products, and vegetables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has found levels of NDMA in some ranitidine&#xD;
      products similar to the levels you would expect to be exposed to if you ate common foods like&#xD;
      grilled or smoked meats. The ranitidine that will be used in this study has been tested twice&#xD;
      (months apart) and shown to have stable NDMA levels well below the acceptable daily limit. Of&#xD;
      note, the risk of NDMA with ranitidine is only relevant with prolonged chronic administration&#xD;
      as at the acceptable limit, there is approximately a 1 in 100,000 chance of cancer after 70&#xD;
      years of exposure to that level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDA has also conducted tests that simulate the potential formation of NDMA from ranitidine&#xD;
      after it has been exposed to acid in the stomach with a normal diet. Results of these tests&#xD;
      indicate that NDMA is not formed in typical stomach conditions. Similarly, if ranitidine is&#xD;
      exposed to a simulated small intestinal fluid, NDMA is not formed. Other laboratory&#xD;
      experiments suggest a combination of nitrites, such as found in processed meats, and an&#xD;
      acidic environment may increase NDMA formation, however the levels of nitrites tested were&#xD;
      very high. Separately, a previous study in 10 healthy volunteers showed that volunteers who&#xD;
      received ranitidine had an increase in urinary NDMA excreted over 24 h. The level of increase&#xD;
      was greater than would be expected from laboratory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study is being performed to determine if and how much NDMA is produced from&#xD;
      ranitidine in the human body and whether nitrite-containing foods may increase formation of&#xD;
      NDMA. The study will use a prescription dose of ranitidine (300 mg) to test whether there is&#xD;
      increased urinary NDMA excretion levels over 24-hours after ranitidine administration in&#xD;
      comparison to placebo when participants are administered low nitrite/NDMA meals and when&#xD;
      subjects are administered high nitrite/NDMA meals. On 4 different days, each participant will&#xD;
      receive ranitidine or placebo with high nitrite/NDMA meals and ranitidine or placebo with low&#xD;
      nitrite/NDMA meals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has learned that some ranitidine medicines,&#xD;
      including some products commonly known as the brand-name drug Zantac, contain a nitrosamine&#xD;
      impurity called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) at low levels. NDMA is classified as a probable&#xD;
      human carcinogen (a substance that could cause cancer) based on results from laboratory&#xD;
      tests. NDMA is a known environmental contaminant and found in water and foods, including&#xD;
      meats, dairy products, and vegetables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has been investigating NDMA and other nitrosamine impurities in blood pressure and&#xD;
      heart failure medicines called Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) since 2018. In the&#xD;
      case of ARBs, the FDA has recommended numerous recalls as it discovered unacceptable levels&#xD;
      of nitrosamines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDA has found levels of NDMA in ranitidine active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished&#xD;
      drugs that are similar to the levels you would expect to be exposed to if you ate common&#xD;
      foods like grilled or smoked meats. FDA has requested removal of all ranitidine products from&#xD;
      the market because some ranitidine products have NDMA levels above the acceptable limits (96&#xD;
      nanograms per day or 0.32 parts per million for 300 mg per day of ranitidine) and that levels&#xD;
      of NDMA in ranitidine may increase to unacceptable levels over time. However, FDA has not&#xD;
      withdrawn approvals of ranitidine new drug applications and abbreviated new drug applications&#xD;
      and if a company can show, through scientific data, that their ranitidine product is stable&#xD;
      and the NDMA levels do not increase over time to unsafe levels, FDA may consider allowing&#xD;
      that ranitidine product back on the U.S. market. The ranitidine that will be used in this&#xD;
      study has been tested twice (months apart) and shown to have stable NDMA levels well below&#xD;
      the acceptable daily limit. Of note, the risk of NDMA with ranitidine is only relevant with&#xD;
      prolonged chronic administration as at the acceptable limit, there is approximately a 1 in&#xD;
      100,000 chance of cancer after 70 years of exposure to that level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDA has also conducted tests that simulate the potential formation of NDMA from ranitidine&#xD;
      after it has been exposed to acid in the stomach with a normal diet. Results of these tests&#xD;
      indicate that NDMA is not formed in typical stomach conditions. Similarly, if ranitidine is&#xD;
      exposed to a simulated small intestinal fluid, NDMA is not formed. Other in vitro experiments&#xD;
      suggest a combination of nitrites, such as found in processed meats, and an acidic&#xD;
      environment potentiate formation of NDMA. For that reason, prior to requesting removal of&#xD;
      ranitidine products from the market, the FDA had advised consumers who wished to continue&#xD;
      taking these medications to consider limiting consumption of nitrite-containing foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Separately, a previous study in 10 healthy volunteers showed that single dose administration&#xD;
      of ranitidine 150 mg was associated with ~400-fold increase in urinary NDMA excreted over 24&#xD;
      h. This level of increase is substantially greater than would be expected from laboratory&#xD;
      testing. Further evaluation is necessary to determine if and how much NDMA is produced from&#xD;
      ranitidine in the human body and whether nitrite-containing foods may potentiate formation of&#xD;
      NDMA in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ranitidine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ranitidine is an over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription drug. Ranitidine is an histamine-2&#xD;
      (H2) blocker, which decreases the amount of acid secreted by the stomach. Over-the-counter&#xD;
      ranitidine is approved to prevent and relieve heartburn associated with acid ingestion and&#xD;
      sour stomach and the approved dosage regiment is up to 150 mg twice a day. Prescription&#xD;
      ranitidine is approved for multiple indications, including treatment and prevention of ulcers&#xD;
      of the stomach and intestines and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and the&#xD;
      approved dosage regimen is up to 150 mg twice a day or 300 mg once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To evaluate 24-hour urinary excretion of NDMA after oral administration of ranitidine&#xD;
      compared to placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate plasma ranitidine, NDMA, and dimethylamine (DMA) after oral administration&#xD;
           of ranitidine compared to placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate urinary excretion amounts over 24-hours of ranitidine and DMA after oral&#xD;
           administration of ranitidine compared to placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate 24-hour urinary excretion and plasma concentration of NDMA and DMA with&#xD;
           administration of high nitrite/NDMA meals compared to low nitrite/NDMA meals&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose, 4-period crossover study with 18&#xD;
      healthy subjects. Subjects check-in on Day -2 and receive the following 4 treatments starting&#xD;
      on Day 1, with one washout day between treatment days. The treatments consist of oral&#xD;
      administration of either a single dose of ranitidine (300 mg) or placebo administered at time&#xD;
      0 hr. All subjects will be provided low nitrite/NDMA meals for the first two periods of the&#xD;
      study and high nitrite/NDMA meals for the last two periods of the study. This ordering of&#xD;
      meals will allow purchasing a single lot of perishable items for different meals and to&#xD;
      simplify meal preparation and serving at the study site. The four treatments are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Ranitidine + low nitrite/NDMA meal;&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Placebo + low nitrite/NDMA meal;&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Ranitidine + high nitrite/NDMA meal;&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Placebo + high nitrite/NDMA meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will report to the study site for screening from Days -28 to -3 and then will return&#xD;
      to the site on Day -2 for baseline assessments. Subjects will receive three standardized&#xD;
      meals per day starting on Day -1. Subjects will be served meals from a pre-specified menu for&#xD;
      check-in and for all washout and treatment days. Subjects will be instructed to finish all&#xD;
      their meals within 25 minutes with no leftovers. Subjects will only consume foods served to&#xD;
      them at planned meal and snack times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two different full day menus of low nitrite/NDMA and high nitrite/NDMA meals have been&#xD;
      developed. Additional details regarding the meals will be specified in the Meal Preparation&#xD;
      Plan. Meals will be identical for treatments A and B (low nitrite/NDMA meal) of the study and&#xD;
      a separate set of identical low nitrite/NDMA meals will be served on the washout days prior&#xD;
      to treatment. Likewise, meals will be identical for treatments C and D (high nitrite/NDMA&#xD;
      meal) and a separate set of identical high nitrite/NDMA meals will be served on the washout&#xD;
      days prior to treatment. The last meal on Day -1, Day 2, Day 4, and Day 6 should be&#xD;
      administered at approximately 18:00 to permit at least 12-hour fasting prior to dosing.&#xD;
      Subjects will be provided with distilled water to drink throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On study treatment days, the first meal will be provided at the time of dosing. Subjects will&#xD;
      be instructed to swallow the medication with approximately 250 mL of room temperature&#xD;
      distilled water and begin eating within two minutes after dosing. Subjects are required to&#xD;
      eat each meal in its entirety during the study. If the meal is not finished, the reason&#xD;
      should be recorded, along with what was not eaten, and a picture of the remaining food should&#xD;
      be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to and following study drug or placebo administration on Day 1, subjects will undergo&#xD;
      assessments as described in the Schedule of Events. There will be one day of washout between&#xD;
      periods. Participants will be confined in the study clinic from Day -2 until the morning of&#xD;
      Day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening visit, the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed to ensure&#xD;
      the subject is eligible for the study. Subjects will be shown the low and high nitrite/NDMA&#xD;
      menus and informed that each meal in the menu must be finished in its entirety. The subject&#xD;
      must agree to consume all planned meals in order to be eligible to participate. The informed&#xD;
      consent form will be reviewed with the subject by a member of the study team and the subject&#xD;
      will be encouraged to ask questions to ensure he or she has a good understanding of the&#xD;
      study. If the subject is eligible and agrees to participate, the subject will be asked to&#xD;
      sign the informed consent form before any study specific procedure is performed, including&#xD;
      randomization. Results of all screening tests will be evaluated by the study&#xD;
      clinician/investigator against the inclusion/exclusion criteria to confirm subject&#xD;
      eligibility. For subjects that are eligible, a molecular diagnostic test for severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will be performed just before or at check-in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, urine and blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessments will occur before&#xD;
      or after drug or placebo administration at the following timepoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine samples will be collected using separate collection containers over 24 h.&#xD;
           Collection times will occur at 0 (pre-dose), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 24 h. Subjects will be&#xD;
           instructed to void their bladder at each collection time and total weight of the sample&#xD;
           will be recorded. If a subject must void their bladder at an unscheduled time, the&#xD;
           unscheduled voids will be collected, and total weight of the unscheduled voiding will be&#xD;
           recorded. The unscheduled voiding sample will be treated, analytically analyzed, and&#xD;
           reported as part of scheduled sample collection for determining cumulative amounts of&#xD;
           NDMA, ranitidine, and DMA excreted over 24 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasma samples will be collected at 0 (pre-dose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 14,&#xD;
           and 24 h post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be discharged from the study after completion of all study procedures. If a&#xD;
      subject discontinues from the study prematurely, all procedures scheduled for the end of the&#xD;
      study will be performed. Meals (timing and components), activity levels, and general&#xD;
      conditions in the study clinic will be standardized to the extent possible on the treatment&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
