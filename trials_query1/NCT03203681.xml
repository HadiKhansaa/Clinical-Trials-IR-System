  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low testosterone affects more than 10% of men worldwide, with high incidence in the&#xD;
      elderly.This will be a prospective case study. The investigators will identify men with&#xD;
      hypogonadism in our clinic interested in Natesto for testosterone replacement therapy (TRT).&#xD;
      Natesto is a relatively new form of testosterone replacement therapy that is delivered&#xD;
      intranasal to men diagnosed with low testosterone. Current advantages to Natesto include ease&#xD;
      of delivery and decreased risk of transference. Recently Natesto 4.5% (125 uL/nostril, 11.0mg&#xD;
      testosterone/dose), three times a day (TID) dosing was shown to also increase serum&#xD;
      testosterone while maintaining normal, though decreased, serum levels of Luteinizing Hormone&#xD;
      (LH) and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone(FSH). 40 participants will be enrolled and receive&#xD;
      treatment with Natesto.The study will identify men with confirmed hypogonadism (testosterone&#xD;
      (T) &lt;350 on 2 consecutive Testosterone samples collected greater than 1.5 hours apart between&#xD;
      6am and 10am with demonstrated symptoms of hypogonadism). Participants with a history of&#xD;
      prostate cancer, testis cancer, azoospermia, or genetic cause of hypogonadism will be&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low testosterone affects more than 10% of men worldwide, with high incidence in the elderly).&#xD;
      While Natesto has been shown to have positive effects on Testosterone while maintaining LH&#xD;
      and FSH, the impact on sperm count has not yet been proven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Duration of Treatment: Participants will take Natesto 11g intra nasally&#xD;
      there times a day (TID) for 16 weeks (120 days) between serum and semen evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population: The study will identify men with confirmed hypogonadism (testosterone (T)&#xD;
      &lt;350 on 2 consecutive Testosterone samples collected greater than 1.5 hours apart between 6am&#xD;
      and 10am with demonstrated symptoms of hypogonadism). Subjects with a history of prostate&#xD;
      cancer, testis cancer, azoospermia, or genetic cause of hypogonadism will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects: 40 participants will be enrolled and receive treatment with Natesto.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:Total participation in the study will be approximately 24-28 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures: Participants will undergo a total of six study visits. At the first visit,&#xD;
      subjects will undergo screening procedures which will include signing of the consent form,&#xD;
      physical exam, assessment for inclusion and exclusion criteria, Sexual Health Inventory in&#xD;
      Men (SHIM) and quality of life questionnaire, blood sample for clinical laboratory&#xD;
      assessment, and a semen analysis. At visit 2, subjects will undergo a second semen analysis&#xD;
      and blood analysis for T. After 12 weeks (90 days), Participants will return for a third&#xD;
      visit for blood sample and semen analysis as well as safety monitoring. The Participants will&#xD;
      also be given SHIM and quality of life questionnaires. This procedure will be repeated at&#xD;
      week 24 to get a final blood and semen analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint will be change in FSH, LH, Estradiol, T, and Semen&#xD;
      Analysis after 12 weeks and 24 weeks of treatment with Natesto. The secondary endpoint will&#xD;
      be monitoring for adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods: Analyses will consist of summaries of the values and total change from&#xD;
      baseline in each value (visit value versus baseline value) using descriptive statistics&#xD;
      (sample size, mean, median, standard deviation, 95% confidence interval, minimum, and&#xD;
      maximum). The change from baseline in each endpoint will compared using a two-sample t-test,&#xD;
      or the Wilcoxon rank sum test if distributional assumptions are violated. The primary time&#xD;
      point of interest for assessing hormone effects is the week 12 visit.&#xD;
