  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Initiated in the 1990s, perioperative Enhanced Recovery Protocols (ERPs) have progressively&#xD;
      gained traction in a wide range of adult surgical disciplines and have decreased hospital&#xD;
      length of stay (LOS), in-hospital costs, complications, and result in a markedly improved&#xD;
      patient care experience that mitigates the physiologic stress of surgery and hastens&#xD;
      recovery. Implementation of ERPs in pediatric surgery is lagging and concerted efforts to&#xD;
      demonstrate both clinical effectiveness and to examine obstacles to implementation are&#xD;
      needed. Specifically, pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) undergoing&#xD;
      elective abdominal surgery represent an ideal population in which to study the implementation&#xD;
      of ERPs. Almost one third of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and a quarter of patients&#xD;
      with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) present before age 20. Up to three-quarters of CD patients&#xD;
      require GI surgery for medically refractory disease and all patients with UC require&#xD;
      colectomy to either manage severe disease or to mitigate cancer risks. Over the past four&#xD;
      years, investigators modified existing adult ERPs to meet the needs of pediatric patients&#xD;
      undergoing elective GI surgery. Based on the positive results of a pilot study, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to conduct a multicenter, prospective, pragmatic, study using a&#xD;
      stepped-wedge, cluster, randomized controlled trial design to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      ERPs while assessing implementation fidelity, sustainability, and site-specific adaptations.&#xD;
      The cluster randomized trial design is ideally suited for this type of pragmatic intervention&#xD;
      implementation. The National Implementation Research Network's five Active Implementation&#xD;
      Frameworks (AIFs), which identifies competency, organization, and leadership as drivers of&#xD;
      implementation, empowers team collaboration, and facilitates rapid-cycle evaluation, will be&#xD;
      used to optimize implementation. The investigators propose to conduct the ENhancing Recovery&#xD;
      In CHildren Undergoing Surgery (ENRICH-US) Study in 18 US hospitals participating in the&#xD;
      Pediatric Surgical Research Collaborative (PedSRC) by implementing and evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the Pediatric ERP in GI Surgery on clinical outcomes for pediatric IBD&#xD;
      patients and by measuring by fidelity and sustainability of the intervention while&#xD;
      identifying organizational, leadership, and competency-based drivers of improved ERP&#xD;
      implementation and sustainability.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This application proposes to implement an ERP for pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and undergoing&#xD;
      elective abdominal surgery. They represent an ideal population in which to study the&#xD;
      implementation of ERPs because almost one third of patients with CD present before age 20 and&#xD;
      up to three-quarters of CD patients require gastrointestinal (GI) surgery for medically&#xD;
      refractory disease. A quarter of UC patients present before age 20 and all patients with UC&#xD;
      require colectomy to either manage severe disease or mitigate cancer risks. The GI surgical&#xD;
      procedures performed in children with IBD are similar to the adult procedures for which ERPs&#xD;
      have been well tested and validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team has previously modified existing adult ERPs to meet the needs of pediatric&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective GI surgery, primarily for IBD, by conducting (a) a systematic&#xD;
      literature review, (b) a national survey to assess readiness for implementation, and (c) an&#xD;
      expert panel adjudication of ERP elements. The investigators also conducted a pilot study to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility, safety, and preliminary effectiveness of the pediatric ERP in 79&#xD;
      pediatric patients who underwent elective GI surgery. Patient and provider education&#xD;
      materials were created, a learning collaborative explored drivers and obstacles to&#xD;
      implementation, patient advocates were engaged to enhance the quality improvement process,&#xD;
      and data were routinely fed back to the implementation team members. The pilot study&#xD;
      demonstrated a 50% decrease in LOS, from 5 to 3 days, near elimination of intraoperative and&#xD;
      post-operative opioid use, and a 30% decrease in perioperative fluid administration, without&#xD;
      any increase in post-surgical complications or re-hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these promising results, the investigators propose the ENhancing Recovery In&#xD;
      CHildren Undergoing Surgery (ENRICH-US) Study in 18 US hospitals that participate in the&#xD;
      Pediatric Surgical Research Collaborative (PedSRC). This multicenter study will use a&#xD;
      stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized, pragmatic clinical trial design to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of ENRICH-US while also assessing implementation fidelity, sustainability, and&#xD;
      site-specific adaptations. The investigators will optimize implementation using the National&#xD;
      Implementation Research Network's five Active Implementation Frameworks (AIFs), which&#xD;
      identify competency, organization, and leadership as drivers of implementation and empower&#xD;
      team collaboration and facilitate rapid-cycle evaluation.&#xD;

This phase consists primarily of individual-level patient (ages 10-18 years undergoing elective GI surgery for IBD) data collection. This phase involves abstraction of existing electronic health records data by the Site Coordinator about current, standard perioperative care received by patients. Patients and parents will complete web-based HRQoL assessments preoperatively, and 5 days and 4-6 weeks post-operatively. Site-specific barriers and facilitators to implementation will be assessed by semi-structured, telephone interviews, conducted by each Site's PI and Coordinator.&#xD;

    <description>The ENRICH-US Protocol includes perioperative counseling and education, maintaining euvolumia through limited perioperative fasting and limited intraoperative fluid resuscitation, early enteral intake and mobilization, limited use of opioids, and non-routine use of surgical drains and tubes. Elements span the pre-, intra-, and post-operative experience for patients and involve care coordination among surgery, anesthesia, and nursing providers. Though individually simple, the concomitant implementation of the combined elements results in a markedly improved patient care experience that mitigates the physiologic stress of surgery and hastens recovery.</description>

    <ipd_description>All data collected during the study will be made available such that further advancement of ERP principles will be made possible by building upon these data. In addition to the peer-reviewed publication of study results and the dissemination of findings through publicly available websites, blogs, and newsletters, the PI and Biostatistics Director will create a patient-deidentified data set that will be made publicly available to researchers. We have included a request for funds to curate this dataset for public use. It will include clinical data and outcomes collected through REDCap for the complete ENRICH-US study, as well as, raw data for the PedsQL health-related quality of life surveys. All data will be fully de-identified. A copy of the study protocol, data definition dictionary, and public use file with instructions will also be generated for ease of use. Data will be made available in a format that will easily be used in mainstream software analysis packages (e.g., ASCII, SAS).</ipd_description>
