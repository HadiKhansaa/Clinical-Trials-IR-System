    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, Multicenter, 22-Week, double-blind and 30-Week open label Study to&#xD;
      Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of X0002 Spray in relief of the signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      subjects with Osteoarthritis of the Knee.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study comprises a 14-day Screening Period, a 22-week Double-blind Treatment Period, and a&#xD;
      30-week Open-label Treatment Period, with an additional 4-week Follow-up Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Screening Period, eligibility will be assessed, including radiographic evaluation&#xD;
      of the target knee joint space. All subjects who provide informed consent and who meet&#xD;
      preliminary eligibility criteria will be treated with placebo spray in a subject blind manner&#xD;
      for 14±3 days from Screening Visit to the Day 1 Visit. Subjects with a placebo response&#xD;
      exceeding 25% improvement in the averaged Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index&#xD;
      [WOMAC] pain subscale score from Screening Visit to Day 1 will be excluded; those who do not&#xD;
      have this magnitude of placebo response and have Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) Grade 2, or 3 on&#xD;
      radiograph of their target knee per the central radiologist will be eligible for&#xD;
      randomization into the Double-blind Treatment Period. These eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 active treatment groups (A or B) with a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      of active:placebo within each treatment group (i.e., 1 subject to active treatment and 1&#xD;
      subject to placebo), and stratified based on K-L Grade 2, or 3 and bilateral or unilateral&#xD;
      knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WOMAC version 3.1 using the NRS will be used for the primary and secondary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoints. Efficacy endpoints will be assessed at the Screening Visit and at Baseline (Day&#xD;
      1), Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 22, 32, 42, and 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will include assessment of AEs, vital signs (blood pressure, respiratory&#xD;
      rate, pulse rate, and oral temperature), clinical laboratory tests, physical examination,&#xD;
      skin irritation, and electrocardiograms (ECGs). In addition, site telephone calls to the&#xD;
      subject will happen on a routine basis for assessment of AEs between visits.&#xD;
