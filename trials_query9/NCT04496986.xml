  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study seeks to determine the incidence of dysphagia and vocal fold mobility&#xD;
      impairment (VFMI) in individuals undergoing cardiovascular surgical procedures. It also seeks&#xD;
      to determine the impact of postoperative swallowing impairment on health-related outcomes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Swallowing impairment and VFMI are common, yet often overlooked, complications of&#xD;
      cardiovascular surgical procedures. The true incidence of both dysphagia and VFMI in this&#xD;
      patient population is unclear due to a lack of rigorous study using instrumental assessment&#xD;
      techniques and validated outcomes in all patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. The&#xD;
      study is therefore aimed to determine the incidence of dysphagia and VFMI in this patient&#xD;
      population and to characterize impairment profiles related to swallowing safety and&#xD;
      efficiency. In addition, the study is also aimed to assess the relative impact of VFMI and&#xD;
      dysphagia on health-related outcomes such as length of hospital stay, pneumonia, sepsis,&#xD;
      reintubation, and discharge status. Participants will undergo two research visits (one pre&#xD;
      and one postoperative) where they will undergo an instrumental swallowing test and complete&#xD;
      several patient report outcomes and quick clinical tests. Finally, health-related outcomes&#xD;
      will be indexed in enrolled participants to determine the impact of dysphagia.&#xD;

    <measure>Penetration Aspiration Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Prior to surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a validated measure used by trained blinded clinicians to assign ratings of safety to swallowing bolus trials. The development and use of an 8-point, equal-appearing interval scale (8 being best; 1 being worst) to describe penetration and aspiration events are described. Scores are determined primarily by the depth to which material passes in the airway and by whether or not material entering the airway is expelled.</description>

    <measure>Yale Residue Severity Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Prior to surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a validated measure used by trained blinded clinicians to assign ratings of efficiency to swallowing bolus trials. The Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale was developed, standardized, and validated to provide reliable, anatomically defined, and image-based assessment of post-swallow pharyngeal residue severity as observed during fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). It is a five-point ordinal rating scale based on residue location (vallecula and pyriform sinus) and amount (none, trace, mild, moderate, and severe).</description>

    <measure>Vocal Fold Mobility Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Prior to surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>During a Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES), the vocal folds will be visualized using a small camera passed through the open nasal passage. The patient will be asked to make a series of vocal tasks so that we can visualize their movement, any immobility will be notated.</description>
