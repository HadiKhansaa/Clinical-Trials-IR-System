  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel group pilot study in&#xD;
      approximately 150 subjects to evaluate the efficacy of dextromethorphan hydrobromide (DXM) on&#xD;
      acute cough in a pediatric population. Subjects will be otherwise healthy males and females&#xD;
      aged 6-11 inclusive who are experiencing acute cough as a symptom of common cold or upper&#xD;
      respiratory tract infection. Subjects must have had onset of symptoms within 3 days of&#xD;
      screening and qualify based on physical exam and symptom questionnaire. Eligible subjects&#xD;
      will be given a single-blind placebo, and fitted with a cough counting device for a 2 hour&#xD;
      run-in period. Qualifying subjects will be stratified by age and then randomized to either&#xD;
      DXM or placebo in a 1:1 ratio and fitted with the cough recording device for the first 24&#xD;
      hours of treatment. Subjects will receive approximately 9 doses of investigational product&#xD;
      over the course of the 4 day study and will complete patient reported outcome questions&#xD;
      before the morning and afternoon doses. Subjects will return to the study site on Day 2 to&#xD;
      remove the cough recorder and on Day 4 (+ 2 days) to complete the final visit. A review of&#xD;
      any reported adverse events will also be completed.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A subchronic, or chronic cough due to any condition other than an URTI or common cold&#xD;
             as established by the investigator, nurse practitioner, or physician's assistant, in&#xD;
             accordance with the American College of Chest Physicians' (ACCP) Guidelines for&#xD;

             the fever is due to reasons other than URTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signs of dehydration (as may be due to vomiting, diarrhea, or lack of fluid intake)&#xD;

             allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of known or suspected allergy or hypersensitivity to dextromethorphan (DXM) or&#xD;
             APAP, or any of the non medicinal ingredients contained in the single-blind&#xD;
             confection, double-blind investigational products, or APAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of taking any of the specified prohibited medications or products within the&#xD;
             corresponding washout periods prior to taking the first dose of investigational&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of taking a medication that is sedating within the past 24 hours prior to&#xD;
             screening (eg sedatives, hypnotics, tranquilizers, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines,&#xD;
             and clonidine).&#xD;

          -  Subject has a sibling contemporaneously participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Randomization Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must complete the 2 hour ambulatory cough counting baseline run-in recording&#xD;
             period and must return to the study site for randomization at least 2 hours after the&#xD;
             recording started.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects whose equipment failed, preventing collection of cough count data for at&#xD;
             least 2 hours during the Baseline Run-in Period, or those who took off the device&#xD;
             during this period will be excluded from further study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who do not return to the study site (before 3:30 pm) in time for the&#xD;
             afternoon dose will not be randomized.&#xD;
