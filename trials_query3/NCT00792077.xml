  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if treatments to kill cancer cells&#xD;
      including lenalidomide and/or radiation therapy can help to control symptoms such as sleep&#xD;
      problems and fatigue in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and/or breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, researchers are trying to learn if treatments to kill cancer cells such as&#xD;
      lenalidomide and/or radiation therapy can also help to control sleep problems and fatigue in&#xD;
      patients with CLL and/or breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, before you begin taking&#xD;
      chemotherapy on Day 1, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to learn about the relationship between&#xD;
           changes in specific protein levels in the blood, your level of fatigue, and sleep&#xD;
           problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will also complete 4 questionnaires that will ask you questions about your symptoms&#xD;
           and your sleep patterns. They will take 20-30 minutes to complete in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From Day 1 through the end of 1st cycle (+/- 3 days), you will wear a watch that records your&#xD;
      body movements. This is called an actigraph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 15 (+/- 3 days), you will be called by a member of the research staff. During these&#xD;
      calls, you will complete the 4 questionnaires that ask about symptoms you are having and&#xD;
      about your sleep patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 29 (+/- 3 days) and end of 1st cycle (+/- 3 days), you will have a clinic visit. At&#xD;
      this visit, you will complete the 4 questionnaires that ask about symptoms you are having and&#xD;
      your sleep patterns. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will also be drawn to learn about the&#xD;
      relationship between changes in protein levels in the blood, your level of fatigue, and sleep&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a sleep test before starting chemotherapy on Day 1 and again on end of 1st&#xD;
      cycle (+/- 3 days). The sleep test is done overnight in a sleep lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sleep study, called a polysomnogram, is a test that records a person's physical state&#xD;
      during various stages of sleep and wakefulness. The study provides information about a&#xD;
      person's sleep stages, body position, blood oxygen levels, breathing events, muscle tone,&#xD;
      heart rate, snoring, and general sleep behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When you arrive at the Sleep Center Laboratory you will be shown to your private room. You&#xD;
      will complete a questionnaire that will ask questions about how much you slept the night&#xD;
      before, how active you have been, and about any caffeine or alcohol you may have had. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will take about 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The member of the sleep lab staff will connect sensors that will record your brain waves,&#xD;
      muscle tone, eye movements, air flow, and limb movements while you sleep. The sensors are&#xD;
      applied to specific areas of your body with paste and gauze or tape. The monitoring equipment&#xD;
      is painless and should not interfere with your sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not a problem to have a drink of water or to use the restroom during the sleep study.&#xD;
      The member of the sleep lab staff will monitor the sleep study from another room throughout&#xD;
      the night and will wake you in the morning to remove the sensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the morning, you will complete a questionnaire about how you slept and how you are&#xD;
      feeling. It will take about 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be on study up to end of 1st cycle (+/- 3 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Sleep studies are a standard test for patients with sleep&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood tests performed for this study and the sleep test will be performed at no cost to&#xD;
      you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 12 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
