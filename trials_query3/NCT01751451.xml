  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In April 2011, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the oral drug&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate (Zytiga ®) in combination with prednisone (a steroid) to treat patients&#xD;
      with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have received prior docetaxel&#xD;
      (chemotherapy). In December 2012, the FDA approved Zytiga ® in combination with prednisone to&#xD;
      treat patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have not received&#xD;
      prior chemotherapy. Degarelix (Firmagon ®), a testosterone lowering agent given as a monthly&#xD;
      injection, is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate abiraterone acetate and prednisone in combination with&#xD;
      degarelix as a possible treatment for PSA recurrent prostate cancer as compared to&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate alone and degarelix alone. This will be the first time these drugs will&#xD;
      be used together.&#xD;
