  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, parallel group, double-blind, sham-controlled, multicenter&#xD;
      clinical trial following patients to 2 years. The objective is to assess the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of Bronchial Rheoplasty for the treatment of the symptoms of chronic bronchitis&#xD;
      in adult COPD patients with moderate to severe chronic bronchitis. A total of 270 patients&#xD;
      will be randomized at up to 40 study centers in the United States, Canada, and Europe.&#xD;

             or the sum is 6 points and the patient's total CAT score is &gt; 20 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient has a pre-procedure post-bronchodilator FEV1 percent predicted of ≥ 30%.&#xD;
